Well with triangles it was more succesful to achieve a cut out effect for the triangle.
Maybe I'll have to rewrite the one for creating a circle. Anyhow this cost me a bit of time.
Also the triangle function can be much more effecient. 
And dealing with positions in 3D also need some more understanding.
